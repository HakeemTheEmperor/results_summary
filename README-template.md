## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

In the process of carrying out this project, I learnt more on CSS animations, grid, flex box and also sizing

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div class="items">72 <span class="comment">/ 100</span></div>
```
```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
    } 
    to {
        opacity: 1;
    }
}
```


### Continued development

I intend to continue learning on CSS animations
